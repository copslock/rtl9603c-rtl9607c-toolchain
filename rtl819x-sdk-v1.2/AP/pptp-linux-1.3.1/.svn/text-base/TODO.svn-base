- clean up -T errors in pptp-command,

23rd December 2000

Things to do:
  Autoconf/automake this beastie.
  Fix do_gre_copy semantics to properly handle multiple calls.
   Like the call manager, there should only be one gre-copy process
   per connection.  This process needs to funnel packets to different
   output tty's, though, depending on the call-id embedded in the
   GRE encapsulation.  pptp.c must then be modified to use an
   already-existing gre-copy process in the same way it uses an
   already-existing call manager.
