.SH NAME
pptp \- PPTP driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pptp
.I "<pptp-server-IP> <pptp-options> [ppp-options] ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.B pptp
establishes the client side of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using
the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).  Use this program to
connect to an employer's PPTP based VPN, or to certain cable and ADSL
service providers.
.LP
By default, \fBpptp\fR establishes the PPTP call to the PPTP server,
and then starts an instance of \fBpppd\fR to manage the data transfer.
However, \fBpptp\fR can also be run as a connection manager within
\fBpppd\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The first argument on the \fBpptp\fR command line must be the host
name or IP address of the PPTP server.  Remaining arguments are
checked for \fBpptp\fR options, and the arguments from the first
unrecognised option onward are passed as is to \fBpppd\fR unless
\fB--nolaunchpppd\fR is given.
.TP
.B \--nolaunchpppd
do not launch 
.B pppd
but use stdin as the network connection.  Use this flag when including
.B pptp
as a 
.B pppd
connection process using the 
.B pty
option.  See EXAMPLES.
.TP
.B \--phone number
specifies the telephone number to place in the outgoing PPTP call request packet.
.TP
.B \--localbind address
optional binding to a particular local IP address on a multi-homed host.
.TP
.B \--quirks name
adopts special case handling for particular PPTP servers and ADSL modems.
.SH "QUIRKS"

.TP
.B BEZEQ_ISRAEL
modifies packets to interoperate with Orckit ADSL modems on the BEZEQ
network in Israel.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.B Connection to a Microsoft Windows VPN Server

.SH "STATISTICS"
The pptp process collects statistics when sending and receiving
GRE packets. They are intended to be useful for debugging poor PPTP
performance and for general monitoring of link quality. The statistics
are cumulative since the pptp process was started.
.PP
The statistics can be viewed by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the
"GRE-to-PPP Gateway" process, which will cause it to dump them
to the system logs (at the LOG_NOTICE level). A better way to present
the statistics to applications is being sought (e.g. SNMP?).
.PP
The following statistics are collected at the time of writing (April 2003):
.TP
.B rx accepted
the number of GRE packets successfully passed to PPP
.TP
.B rx lost
the number of packets never received, and presumed lost in the network
.TP
.B rx under win
the number of packets which were duplicates or had old sequence numbers
(this might be caused by a packet-reordering network if your reordering
timeout is set too low)
.TP
.B rx over win
the number of packets which were too far ahead in the sequence to be
reordered (might be caused by loss of more than 300 packets in a row)
.TP
.B rx buffered
the number of packets which were slightly ahead of sequence, and were
buffered for reordering
.TP
.B rx OS errors
the number of times where the operating system reported an error when
we tried to read a packet
.TP
.B rx truncated
the number of times we received a packet which was shorter than the
length implied by the GRE header
.TP
.B rx invalid
the number of times we received a packet which had invalid or unsupported
flags set in the header, wrong version, or wrong protocol.
.TP
.B rx acks
the number of pure acknowledgements received (without data). Too many
of these will waste bandwidth, and might be solved by tuning the remote host.
.TP
.B tx sent
the number of GRE packets sent with data
.TP
.B tx failed
the number of packets we tried to send, but the OS reported an error
.TP
.B tx short
the number of times the OS would not let us write a complete packet
.TP
.B tx acks
the number of times we sent a pure ack, without data
.TP
.B tx oversize
the number of times we couldn't send a packet because it was over
PACKET_MAX bytes long
.TP
.B round trip
the estimated round-trip time in milliseconds
