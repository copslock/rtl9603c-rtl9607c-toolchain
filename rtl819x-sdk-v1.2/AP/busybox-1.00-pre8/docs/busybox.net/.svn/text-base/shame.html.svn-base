<h3>Hall of Shame!!!</h3>

The following products and/or projects appear to use BusyBox, but do not appear
to release source code as required by the BusyBox license.  This is a violation
of the law!  The distributors of these products are invited to contact <a href=
"mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik Andersen</a> if they have any confusion as
to what is needed to bring their products into compliance, or if they have
already brought their product into compliance and wish to be removed from the
Hall of Shame.

<p>

Here are the details of <a href="/license.html">exactly how to comply
with the BusyBox license</a>, so there should be no question as to
exactly what is expected.
Complying with the Busybox license is easy and completely free, so the
companies listed below should be ashamed of themselves.  Furthermore, each
product listed here is subject to being legally ordered to cease and desist
distribution for violation of copyright law, and the distributor of each
product is subject to being sued for statutory copyright infringement damages
plus legal fees.  Nobody wants to be sued, and <a
href="mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik</a> certainly has better things to do
than sue people.  But he will sue if forced to do so to maintain compliance.
Do everyone a favor and don't break the law -- if you use busybox, comply with
the busybox license by releasing the source code with your product.
